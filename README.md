This repository houses the technical interview test for a senior flutter engineer @ Kippa


# Project overiview

The sample project for this interview is to build a simple flutter application that have the following functions:

- Using the https://newsapi.org/ , get News that has the Keyword "Business", "Africa", Startup". It is totally up to you how you want to display this, 
  Let's see the genius! ðŸ˜ƒ

- Implement a Dart Backend Srever that will enable the app to record sales and customer contact for a business using MongoDB Cloud Atlas(https://cloud.mongodb.com)
  The free/shared plan is going to be sufficient for this sample project.(..we might be wrong ðŸ˜‚)
  You can take a look at the Kippa App (https://kippa.africa) for inspiration. Please keep this as simple as possible. 
  The scope of what you want to manage for the business is totally up to you, as our focus is mostly on code quality, design patterns, test and every sweetness in betweenðŸ˜€
  
  
  Please do not hesistate to reach out to jephtah@kippa.africa if you have any questions or doubts to clear.
  
  Goodluck SoldierðŸš€
