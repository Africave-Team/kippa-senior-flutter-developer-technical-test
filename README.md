# Overiview

This technical test allows you to choose between two projects. Read more about it below. 


## Project 1

- Using the https://newsapi.org/ , get News that has the Keyword "Business", "Africa", Startup". It is totally up to you how you want to display this, 
  Let's see the genius! 😃

- Implement a Dart Backend Srever that will enable the app to record sales and customer contact for a business using MongoDB Cloud Atlas(https://cloud.mongodb.com)
  The free/shared plan is going to be sufficient for this sample project.(..we might be wrong 😂)
  You can take a look at the Kippa App (https://kippa.africa) for inspiration. Please keep this as simple as possible. 
  The scope of what you want to manage for the business is totally up to you, as our focus is mostly on code quality, design patterns, test and every sweetness in between😀
  
## Project 2

Okay maybe we understimated your ninja skills🥷🏾, so the second project is totally up to you! Sweet right? 
Maybe yoy have something better to show us (... we really do hope so 🙂), we want you to tell us what you to build instead. 

Please send an email with Subject Name: ### Kippa Flutter Engineer Technical Challenge (Project Choice)

Then clearly communicate the project you'd like to build or what you intend to do. Sweet right?😀
